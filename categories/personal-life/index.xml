      <description>Something has been bothering me a lot lately. I couldn&amp;#8217;t quite put my finger on it. I haven&amp;#8217;t been sleeping well lately (which isn&amp;#8217;t really that unusual), I&amp;#8217;ve been scatterbrained (again, not that unusual) and really just couldn&amp;#8217;t concentrate on anything. It really bugged me that I couldn&amp;#8217;t quite put my finger on it. Anyone that knows me, knows I&amp;#8217;m not one to talk about my feelings at all, good or bad.</description>
