      <description>What is this? A change to a different platform? So I&amp;rsquo;ve decide to give Hugo a try for my main blogging platform. There are numerous reasons for this, mostly cost involved. I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to move all of my sites from an expensive VM, to cheap AWS buckets.
As for this site, for now at least, it&amp;rsquo;s actually going to be hosted on Gitlab. At least for now.
There are a lot of changes to be made, and a lot of learning, however it should be a fun experience.</description>

      <description>Something has been bothering me a lot lately. I couldn&amp;#8217;t quite put my finger on it. I haven&amp;#8217;t been sleeping well lately (which isn&amp;#8217;t really that unusual), I&amp;#8217;ve been scatterbrained (again, not that unusual) and really just couldn&amp;#8217;t concentrate on anything. It really bugged me that I couldn&amp;#8217;t quite put my finger on it. Anyone that knows me, knows I&amp;#8217;m not one to talk about my feelings at all, good or bad.</description>
